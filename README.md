# Website for Asian Studies Class

This educational website is built for an Asian Studies class, focusing exclusively on Saudi Arabia—one of Asia's fascinating countries.
This project combines all my video presentations into an interactive, user-friendly platform, showcasing Saudi Arabia’s rich culture, history, and modern developments.
Developed using **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**, it’s designed to be both functional, visually appealing, and mobile responsive.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

-   [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
-   [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
